# posematch-bro

posematch-bro is a tool that compares a series of position for a specific skeleton joint set.

You need to provide a `matchVectors` array that is an array of poses (i.e an array of arrays of numbers) as well as a `jointsName` array that is an array of string corresponding of the joints you want to use.

It's pretty specific use case, don't hesitate to contact us for any information.
